<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure used to describe how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run as a function of the input size. Understanding time complexity helps in writing more efficient code.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. A typical example is O(n), where the memory usage grows linearly with input.
