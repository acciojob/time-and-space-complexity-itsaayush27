<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time Complexity is important to show our code is optimizing and efficien.For example is a program takes an input as an string the time complexity of program will be log(n)</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> show how much amount of memory our code will taken.for example if a program takes an input as an array the  Space Complexity is O(n)</p>
